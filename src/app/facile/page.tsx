              I was presented with a new challenge, learning and using
              functional programming in Typescript by using fp-ts. The learning
              curve was one of the toughest i have ever faced, it was like
              starting to code all over again, everything was new and i had to
              work a lot in team and improve my communication to get through and
              deliver my tasks. In the end I was very surprised of how useful it
              can be, especially for big projects, it has a very clean structure
              and is very low maintenance.

              It was not my first time using Nest JS but it surely was the only
              project that used all possibilities of it. Every single feature of
              Nest JS was being used and sometimes even customized to fit better
              for the project needs. Here i deepened my knowledge about this
              framework.

              Here i deepened my agile, communication and team working skills.
              At Facile.it i had the opportunity to work with very specialized
